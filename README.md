# Axe Game

- This is my first game using c++ and raylib library. 
- This game is taught in [udemy's course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104VaU3@ZH05jPKOvVZiQD55K9vAAUrbHm3cZcqlgrwYDMlWMbxB5j0hWjN_jRIQ-nwcldfn/)
- The game is called axe-game. It is a very basic game in which a player(circle) has to avoid a collision with an axe(rectangle). Collision is checked by keeping track of edges of the player and the axe.
